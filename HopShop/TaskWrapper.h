/*	File:			TaskWrapper.h
	Description:	 This class is a generalized process handling class that makes asynchronous interaction with an NSTask easier.	There is also a protocol designed to work in conjunction with the TaskWrapper class; your process controller should conform to this protocol.	TaskWrapper objects are one-shot (since NSTask is one-shot); if you need to run a task more than once, destroy/create new TaskWrapper objects.
