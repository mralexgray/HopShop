/*
 File:			TaskWrapper.m
 
 Description:	 This is the implementation of a generalized process handling class that that makes asynchronous interaction with an NSTask easier.	Feel free to make use of this code in your own applications.	TaskWrapper objects are one-shot (since NSTask is one-shot); if you need to run a task more than once, destroy/create new TaskWrapper objects.

 Version History: 1.1/1.2 released to fix a few bugs (not always removing the notification center,
 forgetting to release in some cases)
 1.3		fixes a code error (no incorrect behavior) where we were checking for
 if (task) in the -getData: notification when task would always be true.
 Now we just do the right thing in all cases without the superfluous if check.
